Wine Bottle/Image Creation Cheet Sheet
---------------------------------------


Run the following command to generate the wine bottle at a given path:

    32-bit = $ WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/path/to/wine/prefix winecfg
    64-bit = $ WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/path/to/wine/prefix winecfg


Note that the prefix/bottle folder must NOT already exist.


To run common Windows apps

    Open a Wine Bottle control panel: $ wine control
    Open a Wine Bottle file browser:  $ winefile


To install using an installer application:

    $ WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/path/to/wine/prefix wine control

Select the Windows version, etc., then from the control panel that opens,
click "Add/Remove Programs".  In the dialog that appears, click "Install...",
then loacate the installer app.  When it runs, follow its instructions.


To run the MSI installer

    $ wine msiexec /i <installer-name>.msi
or
    $ wine start <installer-name>.msi


To launch a Windows application listed in the Start Menu

    $ wine start 'c:\<path\to\exe\windows\style>'
or
    $ wine start "c:\\<path\\to\\exe\\windows\\style>"
or
    $ wine start /unix "<path/to/exe/*nix/style>"

where the path will be something like

    'C:\users\Public\Start Menu\Programs\GOG.com\Riven\Riven.lnk'

Add (escaped) parameters for Windows apps to CLI commands as normal (for bash).


To run a Windows application in a wine bottle using the CLI:

    $ wine explorer /desktop=<desktop-name>,800x600 <application-name>.exe


DOS applications work best when pinned to a single CPU:

    $ taskset -c 1 wine <application-name>.exe


To combine pinning with launching from the CLI:

    $ taskset -c 1 env WINEPREFIX=<path/to/wine/bottle> wine explorer \
      /desktop=<application-name>,800x600 <application-name>.exe


For best results, disable compiz.  Never install DirectX (built into Wine).
If the screen doesn't reset itself after a wine app quits, try $ xrandr -s 0
